# Or installing a Repository Locally on Your Machine

This guide will walk you through the process of installing a repository from a remote source onto your local machine. This can be useful for development, testing, or simply exploring the contents of the repository offline.

## Prerequisites:

- Basic understanding of command-line interface (CLI)
- Git installed on your machine
- A code repository URL that you want to clone
Steps:

## Clone the Repository:
Open your command-line interface (e.g., Terminal on macOS or Command Prompt on Windows) and navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository. Use the following command to clone the repository:


```js
  git clone <repository_url>
  Replace <repository_url> with the actual URL of the repository you want to clone.
```

## Navigate to the Repository Directory:
Once the cloning process is complete, navigate into the cloned repository's directory using the cd command:

```js
  cd <repository_directory>
  Replace <repository_directory> with the name of the directory that was created during the cloning process.
```

## Install Dependencies:
```js
  yarn
  Replace <repository_directory> with the name of the directory that was created during the cloning process.
```

## Run the Application (If Applicable):

```js
  yarn dev
```
